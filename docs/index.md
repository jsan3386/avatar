## Avatar Add-on

Integration of Makehuman inside Blender with a intuitive interface for a fast prototyping of dressed human models. The add-on includes a small subset of assets available in Makehuman. The 3D model shape can be slightly modified by a set of different parameters. The purpose of this add-on is to have a ready to use tool to generate large datasets that can be used to train neural networks. Everything can be scripted in python, most useful functions and explanations are given below.


- There is also available a MoCap software using this add-on.
- A new version integrating SMPL model for researchers will be made public soon.
