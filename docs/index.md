## Avatar Add-on

Integration of Makehuman inside Blender with a intuitive interface for a fast prototyping of dressed human models. The add-on includes a small subset of assets available in Makehuman. The 3D model shape can be slightly modified by a set of different parameters. The purpose of this add-on is to have a ready to use tool to generate large datasets that can be used to train neural networks. Everything can be scripted in python, most useful functions and explanations are given below.
