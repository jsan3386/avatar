# Important info about skeletons
We have different reference systems
1) Skeleton treated like rigid object - skel.matrix_world
2) Skeleton bones
	2.1) Reference position bones - skel.data.bones[bone_name].matrix_local
		this is the same as - skel.pose.bones[bone_name].bone.matrix_local
		or at least I don't know the difference between these 2 matrices
	2.2) Rotation respect bone reference position - skel.pose.bones[bone_name].matrix_basis

	2.3) skel.pose.bones[bone_name].matrix = matrix_local @ matrix_basis
		the doubt on this matrix is when is updated
		I guess need to make call to update() to really update when skeleton moves

# In motion_utils there are functions to transfer movement to a skeleton given a set of 3D points. Is assumed
points 3D are in CPM order and correspond only to 15 joints. This algorithm could be updated to process more
3D points.
The original version of this algorithm is in the file create_bvh_from_3d_points.py. Unfortunately, in the file, the way the points are processed need to call update() function many times with causes big delays if want to 
be used in real time. For this reason the algorithm is improved in the motion_utils.py version.

# When transfer bvh file to our skeleton many problems appeared.
	1) Original makewalk addon is developed for Blender 2.79. Once made changes necessary to make addon
work for Blender 2.8 we found that some of the bvh files before were working, are not working anymore.
Fix the overall addon is quite complicated since there are many files and addon do many operations I can't 
understand.
A shortened version of the addon is kept in the folder retarget_motion_makewalk

	2) I developed another version, more simpler to transfer motion from bvh to the human model
		2.1) The hips rotations are not working. Mixamo and CMU skeletons have hips pointing in 
complete different direction. Moreover, the bones connecting hips with legs are not present. This factor
makes fail most of the rotations on the legs, or I believe so.
Need to keep working on that in the future.
		2.2) As intermediate solution, to compute hips location and rotation, I use functions from 
motion_utils.py file. This provokes sometime a little bit of bouncing. Need to keep working on that too.
